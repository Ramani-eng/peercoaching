## 🚩 Problem Statement

Most individuals lack structured, affordable, and personalized coaching to reach their personal or professional goals. Traditional coaching platforms depend heavily on human mentors, making them expensive and less scalable. Meanwhile, peer learning communities lack personalization, progress tracking, and nudging systems that drive habit formation.

**PeerCoach bridges this gap by:**

- Matching peers based on skill goals and strengths
- Providing AI-generated plans & nudges
- Tracking progress, goals, and reflections
- Delivering a mobile-first PWA experience
